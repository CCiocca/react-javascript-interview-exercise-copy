In this version I added the constructor in the start file.

I changed styles using bootstrap for styles and eventual responsiveness (rows and cols, currently commented in counter.js file, uncomment to see the difference), fontawesome for fa-solid effect, and custom css for not-standars styles

As per elements, I added the company logo (got it from the email) and the counter title. Also added divs to be able to manage the elements in the page.
Buttons colors and background colors from the total are taken from the Corintis logo.

The "copy" files (ex 5 optional) have been left in original style, to allow a comparison between styled and non styled code. A styleCopy file is commented in the index file and needs to be uncommented to see the original style.
